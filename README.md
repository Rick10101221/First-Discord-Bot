# Inspiration
I wanted to figure out how to build Discord bots, and now I finally got the time and the opportunity to do so. This is a beginner project so I could focus on my more in-depth DiscordJS project, [PokemonBot](https://github.com/Rick10101221/pokemonBot).

# What It Does
This is a Gorilla bot that aims to...act like a Gorilla. Press F to pay respects when Gorilla is in your server. Gorilla also has a zero curse-policy. That means whenever you curse, Gorilla is watching. 

# What's Next for my First Discord Bot
I either want to flush this out OR see if I build an even more sophisticated version of Gorilla so that it can be used for a wide variety of purposes (mainly humor-oriented).
